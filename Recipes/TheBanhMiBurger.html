        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I'm combining my favorite sandwich with my other favorite sandwich to create my new favorite sandwich. If, that is, you consider a burger a sandwich, which I do. But forget about the burger, because no matter what kind of meat you use for your sandwich, learning how to make a banh mi version of it, is something everyone should know how to do.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h2>For the Burger:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>

                <li>⅛ teaspoon five-spice powder</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>For the Sandwich:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Sriracha</li>
            <li>2 French sandwich rolls</li>
            <li>½ cup julienned carrot⅛ teaspoon five-spice powder</li>
            <li>½ cup julienned daikon radish</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar</li>
            <li>8 thin slices English cucumber</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sliced jalapeno pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh cilantro leaves, or to taste</li>
        </ul>



        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Combine beef, fish sauce, soy sauce, freshly ground black pepper, and 5-spice powder in a bowl, and mix until evenly combined. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled.</li>
                <li>Mix mayonnaise, hoisin, and Sriracha together in a small bowl for sauce. Keep chilled until needed.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil.</li>
                <li>Cut open rolls, remove about 1/2 of the inside crumb, and place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until toasted, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, using damp hands, shape beef mixture into two burger patties sized to match your rolls or buns. Keep in the refrigerator until needed.</li>
                <li>Combine carrots and daikon radish in a bowl. Add rice vinegar and toss to coat. Refrigerate until needed.</li>
                <li>Preheat a charcoal grill to high heat.</li>
                <li>Cook burgers over the hot coals until desired doneness is reached and they spring back to the touch, turning as needed, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Slather toasted buns with mayo mixture. Place cucumbers and jalapeno slices on bottom of rolls, and top with cooked burgers. Top with carrot-radish mixture and cilantro.</li>

            </ol>
